Query Analysis Submission

Problem 1a
SQL Query:
SELECT name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'engineering' 
    AND salary > 85000 
ORDER BY salary DESC;

Problem 1b
SQL Query:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) as avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Senior%';

Problem 5: Lazy Evaluation Explanation
The `filtered_names()` function is implemented using a generator expression, which makes it lazy. This means it processes data on-demand rather than all at once. When called, it returns a generator object that yields one matching employee name at a time without creating intermediate lists in memory. This approach is memory efficient, especially for large datasets, as it only processes one record at a time. It also enables better performance when the full result set isn't needed, as iteration can stop early once the desired number of results is found.
