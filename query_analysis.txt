Query Analysis Submission

Problem 1a
SQL Query:
SELECT name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'engineering' 
    AND salary > 85000 
ORDER BY salary DESC;

Problem 1b
SQL Query:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) as avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Senior%';

Problem 5: Lazy Evaluation Explanation
The `filtered_names()` function is implemented using a generator expression, which makes it lazy. This means it processes data on-demand rather than all at once, yielding one matching employee name at a time without creating intermediate lists in memory. This approach is memory efficient, especially for large datasets, as it only processes one record at a time. It also allows for early termination of processing if the full result set isn't needed, and can handle infinite or very large data streams that wouldn't fit in memory all at once.
